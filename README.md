# ModMenuinOptions

Adds a options menu for your mods to your options menu!

Instead of going through the mods menu, make it quicker with MMiO! (the official acronym i guess)

also yes i know the name doesnt make sense but mmio just sounds cooler... 

pretty sure its a computer term too and i like computers

download today using the code button.

### features
* the mmio mod select menu in your options menu
* can enable or disable
* can place on either the top or the bottom of the options menu
* the mods are sorted by priority from negative to positive.

### known issues:

* main config tab with a custom name does not keep the custom name (eg: handy)
* cryptid does not work
* handy's search feature does not work
* can go off screen (just disable some, you dont need to have *your entire mod collection* in an easy to access config)

if you know any other issues please feel free to dm me on discord at "bestspark687090".
